## Week 1 Step 4

### Writing Your First Function

## Configuring Azure

*This week, you will be going through steps to set up tools needed to be successful in this camp. If you are already familiar with some, feel free to skip to the end and complete the task to move on.*

### Azure

<details>
<summary>:question: So what is "Azure"?</summary>
    </br>

**According to Microsoft:**
> Azure is an ever-expanding set of cloud services to help your organization meet your business challenges. It’s the freedom to build, manage, and deploy applications on a massive, global network using your favorite tools and frameworks.

If you want to learn more about Azure and all its cloud applications, feel free to check out this [link](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-azure/), an overview of its capabilities.

<summary>:exclamation: How do I create an account?</summary>
    </br>

1. To create an Azure account, go to: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/ and press **Start free** to be relocated to a signup page.

![register](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69332964/113362023-5dadbf80-931b-11eb-814c-5ec22c2f818d.png)

2. After signing in with your Microsoft account and filling in your personal details, you will be asked to add a credit card. 

> Rest assured, this is only for security purposes (preventing multiple free accounts per person), and **you won't be charged** unless you choose to buy a premium account, which we do not need for this course. 

If you need some help navigating Azure, check out this super helpful [resource](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/get-started/) provided by Microsoft.

<summary>:exclamation: How can I create a resource and deploy a simple HTTP trigger function with it?</summary>
  </br>
  
1. Click “Create a resource” in your portal (near the top left of the screen)

<img width="1134" alt="resourceCreate" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70852990/104529849-a6859000-55d8-11eb-9d4e-335f21c94776.png">

2. Choose “Function App” (it should be in the list of popular resources, with the lightning logo)

<img width="589" alt="FunctionApp" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70852990/104529847-a5ecf980-55d8-11eb-8ca2-b739ea386472.png">

3. Create a new resource group, with a unique resource name (make it relevant to what the app does). Add a unique Function App name as well.
4. Make sure the "Code" button is selected next to Publish, the Runtime stack is Node.js, and the Version selected is 12 LTS

<img width="763" alt="codeDocker" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70852990/104529846-a5ecf980-55d8-11eb-8883-a128333c4bff.png">

5. Select your region
6. All of the other tabs in this step should be correctly filled (you can double-check them if you want), so you should be ready to click “Create”
7. Deploying may take a few minutes – be patient!
8. Once the function is deployed, open it and go to the “Functions” tap on the left (with symbol {fx}).
9. Click “Add” on this page, and then “HTTP trigger” (in the side window that opens)
10. Click “Add” (at the bottom of the side window) – creating this HTTP trigger may take a few seconds, so remember: patience!

<img width="1167" alt="httpTrigger" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70852990/104529848-a6859000-55d8-11eb-902d-f77bfd3df12a.png">

11. Once this trigger is created, it should open automatically. Click the “Code + Test” tab on the left side, and the code should open.

<img width="1440" alt="code+Test" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70852990/104529845-a5ecf980-55d8-11eb-9c88-64e6e5065a2a.png">

12. If you need to review the code we created, review the livestream.
13. Click “Save” and “Refresh” (in that order, and refresh only once the trigger has completely saved) when you have finished writing your code (or in between – it never hurts).
14. Click “Test/Run” once you are ready to try out your new trigger function. If it all works smoothly, and the code has no errors, you should receive the correct time based on the information inputted!

*One more tip: don’t forget to save! Rewriting code can be challenging and extremely frustrating, so save yourself the trouble!*

## **:pencil: Task 3: Create and deploy an HTTP trigger Azure Function that outputs the current time and date.**

Example output:
```
Hello! The current time is: 17 : 41 : 34 PM
```

This time we'll try developing locally. Follow the directions in this [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-develop-local) to set up and deploy your first Azure Function right in your local machine.

<details>
<summary>:question: Where's the function URL?</summary>
    </br>

Go to the function trigger you are working on, and find this button above the code.
![code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69332964/99188529-73369a00-272a-11eb-93df-04fdce5381df.png)
<br><br/>
</details>

<details>
<summary>:exclamation: How should I test it?</summary>
    </br>

**Option 1:**
Paste the *function url* directly in your browser. Text with the current time should appear.

**Option 2:**
Use **Postman**! Paste the *function url* and make a GET request. In the output box, you should get something like this:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69332964/113361613-63ef6c00-931a-11eb-9380-7d58a3dea1b4.png)
<br><br/>
</details>

## **:camping: To move on, place your function URL in a [repository secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) called `HTTP_ENDPOINT` so we can check your function. Remember to commit the function's code in a file named `httptime.js` to the root of the `week1` branch!**

*Note: Every time you make a new commit to `week1`, we will check your function by making a request.*
